# Simulate

Simulate is a library for easily creating and sharing simulation environments for intelligent agents (e.g. reinforcement learning) or synthetic data generation.

## Install

Install Simulate (preferentially in a virtual environment) with a simple `pip install simulate`

## Options for Reinforcement Learning Support

Simulate comes with additional support for the gym API, stable baselines 3 and sample-factory (experimental)

### Gym Installation

```
pip install simulate[gym]
```

### Stable Baselines 3 Installation

```
pip install simulate[sb3]
```

### Sample Factory Installation (experimental)

**Note** due to version incompatibilities Stable Baselines 3 and Sample Factory cannot both be installed at the same time.
