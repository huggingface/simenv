# Overview

The how-to guides offer a more comprehensive overview of all the tools ðŸ¤— Simulate offers and how to use them. This will help you build 3D environments, define an Actors with Sensors, Actuators and Reward Functions.

The guides assume you are familiar and comfortable with the ðŸ¤— Simulate basics. We recommend newer users check out our [tutorials](tutorial) first.

</Tip>

The guides are organized into five sections:

- <span class="underline decoration-sky-400 decoration-2 font-semibold">General usage</span>: How to define the walls, objects and lighting of an environment.
- <span class="underline decoration-pink-400 decoration-2 font-semibold">Reinforcement Learning</span>: How to create you Actors, Sensors, Actuators and Reward Functions
- <span class="underline decoration-yellow-400 decoration-2 font-semibold">Synthetic data generation</span>: How to use the Simulate library to create synthetic datasets.
- <span class="underline decoration-green-400 decoration-2 font-semibold">Articulation bodies</span>: How to set up robotic limbs, with hinges, joints and sliders.
- <span class="underline decoration-indigo-400 decoration-2 font-semibold">Advanced usage</span>: How to achieve high throughput training with Map Pools and the [sample-factory](https://alex-petrenko.github.io/sample-factory/) RL framework</a>.
