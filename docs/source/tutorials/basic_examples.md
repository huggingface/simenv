# Basic Examples in Simulate

These examples are intended to showcase the basic usage of Simulate: creating a scene, adding objects, and observing physics.

* [`create_and_save.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/simulate/examples/create_and_save.py): This example showcases basic scene assembly and saving as a gltf.
* [`objects.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/simulate/examples/objects.py): This examples showcases the different objects we have in HuggingFace Simulate.
* [`simple_physics.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/simulate/examples/simple_physics.py): This example showcases a basic falling object physics experiment.
* [`structured_grid_test.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/simulate/examples/structured_grid_test.py): This example tests the StructuredGrid object in Simulate
