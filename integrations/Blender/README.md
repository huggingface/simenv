## Blender Integration

### Install addon in Blender
This integration has been developed for Blender 3.2. You can install Blender from https://www.blender.org/download/

Inside Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...` and select the `simenv_blender.zip` file.

### Run in Blender
You might need to run Blender with admin rights.

You can find an example script using the `simenv` API in `simenv/examples/blender_example.py`

To use the addon inside Blender, open the side submenu (little arrow in the top right), go in the `Simulation` category and click on `Import Scene`.
