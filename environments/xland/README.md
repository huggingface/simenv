# XLand-like environment

Procedurally generated environments inspired by [XLand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12808) from Deepmind.

For now, we are building the procedural generation using [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) (WFC), and we use an external dependency called [fast-wfc](https://github.com/math-fehr/fast-wfc), which contains a really fast implementation of WFC in C++.

## Installation

First, ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed, since we will be using Cython to speed up things.

Then create a virtual env, activate it, and then install `simenv`:

```
cd .. && git clone https://github.com/huggingface/simenv.git
cd simenv
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then install the `xland` package:

```
cd environments/xland
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

And it's done!

### Style

Before you merge a PR, fix the style (we use `isort` + `black`)
```
make style
```

## Basic Usage

A minimalistic example to generate from an example map:

```
from xland import create_scene
from xland.utils import create_2d_map

# Create example map from csv file on examples
example_map = create_2d_map(name="example_map_01")

# Sample from example map and show interactive mode
create_scene(width=8, height=8, sample_from=example_map, show=True)
```

Other scripts might be found in the folder `scripts`. The map that is used as example is in CSV format for human readability inside the `benchmark/examples`.
